## React simpleDashboard

This is a personal project that extends my learning after taking a Udemy course on React Web Development, where i built and uploaded an interactive web-based code editor to NPMJS â€“ [jsbook-jsnote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jbook-jsnote)

This website has a login page, sign up page, and a dashboard with CRUD operations built using typescript, react hooks, axios and Material UI by fetching data from dummy APIs.

## Notable library usage

- Material UI
- Redux
- React-Hook-Form
- Axios
- Yup schema for input validation
- Notistack for alerts
- React-router-dom
- Redux-persist
